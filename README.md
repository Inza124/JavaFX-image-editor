## General info
Graphical interface was created in FXML language. The program was written based on the MVC pattern, but as the program does not use any database, the model class has been reduced to the characteristics of the images. The program can be run after downloading the repository. All you need to do is have Jave installed, a folder with sample photos that can be edited has also been added

## Inspiration
I created this program in order to pass the course at the university. When I created graphics, I was often surprised at how much the interface of popular graphics programs can be complicated. I wanted to create an application whose interface will be understandable for everyone
